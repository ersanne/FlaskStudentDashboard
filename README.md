# ENU Studentportal

This is a studentportal project designed for Advanced Web Technologies at Edinburgh Napier University.
The website is meant as a central place of university resources as well as offering various collaboration tools and social features.

Unfortuntely due to time limitiations the project is very limited compared to the original concept, however it provides a good module search and overview. It repliactes and improves the functionality of https://www.modules.napier.ac.uk/ and most importantly is much more responsive. It uses data scraped from this source, currently this data is not updated automatically.  

I plan to build this project with a focus on a better module search, this can be found [here](https://github.com/ersanne/napiermodules).

## To run
The project can be deployed with docker-compose or can be run locally by running run.py (config options must be set and mongodb must be available).
